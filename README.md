# RTKFinder

RTKFinder is a tool for Japanese learners who have used James Heisig's [Remembering the Kanji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembering_the_Kanji_and_Remembering_the_Hanzi). It allows you to find kanji by keyword and vice versa.

The app used to include primitives and the ability to search by them, but unfortunately this feature has been removed to avoid copyright issues.

You can currently find it hosted here: https://rtk.bgior.com

## Development
The application is a Vue CLI project, you can run it from source by following the steps below:

- Install [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/installation.html): `npm install -g @vue/cli`
- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Run the development server: `npm run serve`

More useful commands:

- Generate the production build: `npm run build`
- Run the linter: `npm run lint`
- Inspect the autogenerated webpack config: `npm run inspect`

## Aknowledgements
The data is based on [heisig-kanjis](https://github.com/sdcr/heisig-kanjis) repository, which in turn comes from [Remembering the Kanji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembering_the_Kanji_and_Remembering_the_Hanzi).
