# RTKFinder

RTKFinder is a tool for Japanese learners who have used James Heisig's [Remembering the Kanji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembering_the_Kanji_and_Remembering_the_Hanzi). It allows you to look up kanji using the primitives learnt in the book, as well as directly through the kanji or keyword.

You can currently find it hosted here: https://rtk.bgior.com

## Development
The application is a Vue CLI project, you can run it from source by following the steps below:

- Install [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/installation.html): `npm install -g @vue/cli`

## Aknowledgements
The data is based on [heisig-kanjis](https://github.com/sdcr/heisig-kanjis) repository, which in turn comes from [Remembering the Kanji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembering_the_Kanji_and_Remembering_the_Hanzi).
